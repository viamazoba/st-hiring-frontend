# See Tickets Frontend challenge

This project is a React application designed for a technical interview. The main objective is to create a user interface that interacts with a Node.js backend through various endpoints. The application will demonstrate the use of state management, forms, and UI frameworks such as Material-UI (MUI).

## Task

Create a single UI that consumes the endpoint `GET /events` from the backend API provided and shows a list of events returned by the API with the information of each event. Use components from MUI to create the UI.
